# Course Files for CS 130 at UNC in Fall 2023

This repository contains the daily activities and notes for Fundamentals of Computer Science (CS 130) at the University of Northern Colorado for the Fall 2023 semester.  Additional files for the course will also be hosted here.

## Directions

### First time setup
So you can save your own work on these activities, you should ***fork*** this repository.  
1. Make sure you are logged in to github.
2. Near the top-right of the page, click on the "Fork" button.
3. On the next page, you should see your username and a textbox with the name of the repository.  Leave that as it is.
4. Click the green "Create fork" button.
5. From now on, you should access the repository via `github.com/<username>/Fall-2023-files`, where `<username>` is your username.

### Staying in sync
From your fork, you can pull in any changes that have been made to the main repository by clicking the "sync fork" button (which should be right below the green "<> Code" button).  

### Using the files
The easiest way to work with the activities given here is to use Github Codespaces. 
1. Click on the green "<> Code" button.
2. That should pop up with the "Codespaces" tab selected, otherwise click on that.
3. The first time you do this, you will see "No Codespaces" but a green button, "Create codespace on main." Click that button.
4. This will open a VS Code texteditor in your browser.  Give it a minute to load, and you can start working.
5. When you are done, make sure you save your work by committing your changes and pushing your changes.

### Seeing the class version
In class we will work on a version of the files together as well.  You can view these if you want to compare your notes to what we did together.  I will do our in-class work on a *branch* of the main repository.  You can pull this branch into your fork, or just view it from the main repository to see what we do together.
